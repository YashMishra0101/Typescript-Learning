# TypeScript Learning Repository 📘🖥️

This repository contains all my learning materials and code snippets related to **TypeScript**. I'm currently focused on improving my understanding of **static typing**, **interfaces**, and **modern JavaScript features** through TypeScript.

My main goal is to learn TypeScript so I can build projects and write cleaner, more efficient code with it. 

TypeScript is like coffee ☕—it may seem strong at first, but once you get used to it, you can't code without it 😅😂👨‍💻.
